# Findings — open implementation defects

Live queue, kept current. **Only open items live here.** Closing one means deleting its entry,
not annotating it — the reasoning belongs in that round's dated record, where it stops needing
maintenance.

A per-entry status field is the thing that goes stale, because closure often arrives as a side
effect of a decision taken under another name and nobody walks back to mark it. A file with no
status field cannot drift that way, so `gates/check-lexicon.py` fails if resolution markers
appear here.

These are defects in the **product**, not in the ontology. Judgements about the ontology's own
claims live in `ontology/instances/graph.json` (`verdicts`, `decisions`), which is a deliberate
split: a decision about a golden relationship and a decision about the CLI surface answer to
different authorities.

Every entry names its alternatives. An item with one path is not a finding, it is a task.

## F-17 — conditional prohibitions in the selected startup corpus need evaluation

`claude/CLAUDE.md` embeds prohibitions inside longer conditional bullets, including
runtime enforcement, lifecycle ownership, destructive operations, and spawn policy.
The private compiler preserves the selected rule text in startup snapshots. Moving
its delivery out of native global files does not establish that a model recognizes
and follows those clauses under context pressure; child reach is a separate question.

The structural observation is supported by the current canonical text. A comparative
behavior result for the current private delivery path is not established here. Review
must preserve each prohibition's intended scope and use a relevant activated snapshot;
a count of clauses or a shorter rewrite alone does not demonstrate better behavior.

Alternatives:

1. **Extract standalone boundaries within a reduction.** Remove the clauses being
   replaced and show their scoped meaning at the new location. Risk: a standalone
   prohibition may lose the condition that made it correct.
2. **Keep the current wording.** Accept the unresolved recognition risk if an
   appropriately scoped comparison does not justify the change.
3. **Enforce decidable boundaries in the owning tool.** Use capability, validation,
   or ownership checks where the action can be controlled; retain prose for judgments
   and surfaces without that authority. Each change needs its own negative control.
4. **Evaluate another current delivery surface.** Compare guide, requested procedure,
   or session-specific delivery against startup placement using `SURFACES.md`.
   Keep the canonical always surface reductions-only and test main/child reach
   separately before adopting a placement.

These alternatives remain open; enforcement and prose placement can be combined
for different clauses. Any behavior experiment needs a bounded question and scope.
